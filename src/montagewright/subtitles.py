"""Putting the words on the picture.

Two things decide where a subtitle can sit, and neither is a constant.

The first is the delivery shape. A 9:16 cut is watched inside an app that
draws its own things over the bottom of the frame -- the handle, the caption,
the row of buttons -- so a caption sitting where a caption traditionally sits
is a caption nobody reads. A 16:9 cut has none of that and only wants the
old title-safe margin. The band is a property of where the film is going, and
writing one number for all of them would be the execution layer deciding
something about distribution.

The second is the font. A line that fits in 16:9 does not fit in 9:16, and
Chinese does not break on spaces, so "how many characters per line" is not a
number either -- it is measured, against the actual font at the actual size.

The words themselves are drawn here rather than by ffmpeg. Its text filters
need libass or libfreetype compiled in, and the build on this machine has
neither, so a tool that depended on them would work here and not there. This
needs only `overlay`, which every build has.

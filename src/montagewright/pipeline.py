"""Run the stages in order and report what happened.

The order is fixed and each stage answers one question:

    rhythm    how long should each shot be, given the music and the material
    subject   where is the thing this shot is about, at a few sampled moments
    reframe   what crop follows that, inside this shot's energy budget

Every semantic question goes to the model; every measurement stays local. The
report at the end says which cuts landed on music and which shots had to
settle for less than the plan asked, because a cut that quietly did neither is
indistinguishable from one that did both.

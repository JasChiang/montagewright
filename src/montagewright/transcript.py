"""What was said, when, and what it actually was.

A transcript card is its own artifact, not more fields on a clip card. A clip
card describes what a take looks like and is worth caching because that stays
true; a transcript is only worth paying for when the speech matters, and it is
useful on its own -- subtitling a finished video is a job that never touches
the edit.

Two halves, split the way everything else here is split. The system recogniser
is very good at when a word was said and reliably wrong about what several of
them were: it emits characters converted from a simplified model (乾 as 幹,
回 as 迴, 面 as 麵), it mishears proper nouns, and it has never heard of the
product on screen. Gemini gets the audio, the picture, and the recogniser's
own text, and corrects the words. Timings are never touched by the model --
they are measured, and a model asked for a timestamp will invent one.

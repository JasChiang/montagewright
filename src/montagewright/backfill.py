"""Putting corrected words back on the clock that measured them.

The recogniser is the only thing here that knows *when*. It hears badly and
times precisely: every character carries a start and an end measured from
the audio. The model hears well and cannot time anything -- asked for a
timestamp it produces a plausible number, which is the one kind of answer
that cannot be checked by looking.

So the text comes from one and the clock from the other, and this is the
join. Corrected characters are aligned against the recognised ones; wherever
they agree the recognised timing is kept exactly, and where they differ the
new characters are spread across the span the old ones occupied. Nothing is
invented and nothing drifts: the first and last moment of a line are moments
the recogniser actually measured.

This follows the approach worked out in caption-lab, which cross-checks
Apple's `SpeechTranscriber` against a second, independent transcription and
writes the agreed text back onto the recogniser's own per-word clock. The
mechanism there re-times genuinely new syllables against energy peaks in the
audio; this spreads them evenly instead, which is cruder and needs no signal
analysis. Where a whole run is unchanged -- which is most of any line --
both approaches give the same answer, because both give the recogniser's.

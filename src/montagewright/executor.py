"""Turn an EDL into concrete render instructions.

This layer has no veto. Every clip in the plan produces a segment, always. When
something cannot be done as written it is done a rung lower and the reason is
recorded with the measurement that forced it -- but the segment still exists,
and the film is still deliverable.

That is a deliberate inversion. The previous system could decide a piece of
material was not worth using and abandon it, or abandon a whole aspect, and it
did: a run during verification dropped every 9:16 candidate because one
declared region wanted to be fully visible, and another dropped the 16:9
aspect because a frame held two similar handsets. Both times the semantic layer
had already said what it wanted and the execution layer said no. Only the
review loop gets to say no here, and it says it about a finished cut.

Degrading is not free either. Each rung down needs its own evidence that the
rung above was attempted and failed, because a layer permitted to skip to the
safe option takes it every time.

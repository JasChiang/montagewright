"""Follow a subject with the crop instead of holding it still.

The semantic layer names the subject; grounding finds it at a handful of
sampled frames; this module turns those observations into a crop that moves.

Three choices here come straight from what the previous system got wrong.

Failure is judged on the raw track, before smoothing. Filtering a trajectory
and then testing the filtered result lets the filter manufacture the problem
it is then blamed for.

The follow uses the ninetieth percentile of where the subject actually went,
not its extremes. One frame of a hand crossing the lens should not define the
whole move; the previous system planned for the worst frame and so planned a
move nobody asked for.

Speed limits live in viewport widths per second, not pixels. A pixel limit is
only meaningful beside the resolution it was written against, which is how the
same constant meant two different things on 1080 and 4K sources.

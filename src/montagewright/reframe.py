"""Follow a subject with the crop instead of holding it still.

The semantic layer names the subject; grounding finds it at a handful of
sampled frames; this module turns those observations into a crop that moves.

Three choices here come straight from what the previous system got wrong.

Failure is judged on the raw track, before smoothing. Filtering a trajectory
and then testing the filtered result lets the filter manufacture the problem
it is then blamed for.

The follow uses the ninetieth percentile of where the subject actually went,
not its extremes. One frame of a hand crossing the lens should not define the
whole move; the previous system planned for the worst frame and so planned a
move nobody asked for.

Speed limits live in viewport widths per second, not pixels. A pixel limit is
only meaningful beside the resolution it was written against, which is how the
same constant meant two different things on 1080 and 4K sources.

    therefore rendered pans correctly while silently freezing push-ins and
    pull-outs at their opening size. For a zoom we map the changing authored
    rectangle to a fixed canvas with the perspective filter; all four
    authored coordinates are consequently evaluated on the same clock.

    The path is authored on the screen clock, so its acceleration is priced
    for the motion a viewer sees. When the shot plays off recorded speed the
    filter still runs on the source-time stream, before the retime, so the
    clock is divided by speed to stretch the same motion across the wider
    source window; the retime then compresses it back and the perceived move
    -- easing and all -- is exactly the one that was authored.

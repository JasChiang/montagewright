    is happier at the source rate anyway.

    What the resampling did cost was a clock that no longer matched. At
    15fps a duration has to land on a multiple of 1/15, so a 12.012s take
    came out 12.133s -- and cards describe this file while the edit cuts the
    original, which left two clocks a tenth of a second apart for no reason.
    Dropping the flag makes them the same to the millisecond, for about nine

    The width is capped rather than set, because `scale=640` is a demand and
    not a limit: handed a 320x240 clip it produced a 640x480 one, larger than
    the file it came from and blurrier than the picture it describes. Nothing
    is gained by enlarging a proxy -- the API caps each video frame at 70
    tokens whatever it is sent, so the extra pixels are discarded before the
    model ever sees them.

    `-2` rounds the height to the nearest even number, which H.264 requires,

    and come out exact; the worst measured case is a 3840x1600 source at
    0.25%, since a short proxy gives that one pixel more to be worth. It only

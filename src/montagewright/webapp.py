"""Drop a folder in, watch it cut, read what it decided.

The CLI already prints every stage and writes the whole account to
report.json. What it cannot do is let someone check the result against the
material without a terminal and a video player: the question after a run is
never "did it finish", it is "which take is that, and why is it framed like
that". So this serves the finished film beside the decisions that produced
it -- source file, in and out, the move, the subject, the reason, the
degradations, and the per-shot verdict.

The run itself is the CLI in a subprocess. Importing the pipeline here would
be faster and would put a long-running job in the request thread; a
subprocess is killable, its stdout is already the progress log, and a crash
takes the run down instead of the server.

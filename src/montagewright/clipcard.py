"""Per-asset facts, written once and reused forever.

A card describes one clip in isolation: what is in it, where the subjects sit,
how the frame is composed, whether the take failed. Everything here is true
without knowing what the clip will be used for, which is exactly why the brief
is not an input. A card written against one brief would have to be rewritten
for the next deliverable made from the same shoot; a card written against the
material alone is good until the material changes.

Subject boxes live here for the same reason. They are expensive to compute,
they never change, and asking for them once per render instead means paying
for the same answer on every rhythm tweak, every second aspect, and every
review round -- eleven calls a run for something that was already known.

What a card deliberately cannot carry is anything comparative or sequential.
Whether this take beats the other two, whether it serves the brief, how long
it should hold: none of that is visible from inside one clip.

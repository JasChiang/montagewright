"""Keep uploaded media addressable across calls and across runs.

The File API holds a file for 48 hours. Uploading the same 74 proxies again
for the second planning call, and again for every review round after that,
costs minutes of wall time and achieves nothing -- the bytes are already
there. What changes between calls is the question, not the material.

The cache is keyed by content hash, so a re-encoded proxy is a different entry
and an unchanged one is a hit however many runs have passed. Entries are
checked against the service before use, because a cache that lies about what
is still live is worse than no cache: the call fails deep inside a paid
request rather than at the point of upload.

"""Reference-conditioned identity grounding with fail-closed lineage.

This module deliberately stops at two reusable boundaries:

* discover identity candidates in one video from an approved identity lock;
* decide whether one exact decoded frame contains the locked target and, only
  when it does, return a box suitable for a geometry-only tracker.

It does not call SAM, choose an edit, or mutate a query lock.  Gemini provides
semantic evidence; local validation remains authoritative for hashes, source
PTS, coordinate order, and every identifier echoed by the model.

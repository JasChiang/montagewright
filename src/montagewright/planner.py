"""Ask Gemini for the editorial decisions, and only those.

This module owns the boundary the whole rebuild is arranged around. The model
decides what a shot means and how long it should be felt; local code decides
what frame that lands on. Nothing here computes a timestamp, and nothing
downstream second-guesses a judgement.

The rhythm pass is the first slice of that. It receives shots that are already
chosen and a grid that is already measured, and answers the one question
neither of those can: how long does each of these want to be, given what is
happening in it and what the track is doing underneath.

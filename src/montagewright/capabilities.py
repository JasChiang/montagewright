"""What the execution layer can actually do, in one place.

The planner cannot ask for a move it has never been told exists. Selection was
returning a subject and a position and nothing else, so a row of three
handsets -- which wants a sweep across them, not a follow of any one -- came
back as a single group subject whose centre never moves, and rendered as a
hold. The capability was missing from the menu, not from the material.

This list is the menu. It is rendered into the prompt so the model chooses
from what exists, and it is the vocabulary the executor dispatches on, so the
two cannot drift apart.

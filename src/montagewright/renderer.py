"""Render a compiled plan with ffmpeg.

Segments are cut individually and then concatenated, rather than assembled in
one filter graph. A graph is marginally faster and much harder to debug: when
one shot is wrong you want to open that shot, not bisect a filter chain. The
segment files are also the natural cache boundary once only part of a cut
changes between review rounds.

Every render produces two files. The deliverable is full resolution; the
preview is small enough to send somewhere. The review loop reads the preview
by design -- judging a cut from a low-resolution copy is what a director does
with a viewing link, and it keeps the reviewer's attention on the edit rather
than on grain.

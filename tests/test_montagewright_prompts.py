"""Every field a prompt names is a field its schema has.

This bug has now landed three times: `camera_move` removed from the selection
schema while six readers still asked for it, `then_subject` taught in prose
after it stopped existing, and the direction prompt telling the model to fill
`material_notes` with a `supersedes` key -- against a schema whose only list
is `unusable`, keyed `superseded_by`, pointing the other way.

None of them raised. A model handed instructions for a field that is not in
its response schema writes something plausible into the fields it does have,
and the run completes, and the guidance silently did nothing.

The existing prompt tests assert that particular sentences are present, which
catches a deletion and nothing else -- a sentence can stay word for word
correct while the field it names is renamed underneath it. This asserts the
join instead: pull every `backticked` identifier out of each prompt and
require the paired schema to define it.

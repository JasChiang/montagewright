"""Names that are used and never defined.

Three runs died on this in one afternoon, each after paying for cards,
direction and selection -- the point where the tool has spent everything and
delivered nothing. All three were a moved import or a moved variable, none
was reachable from a unit test without building most of a run, and every one
of them is visible from the source alone in under a second.

pyflakes is the whole check. This is here so it runs.
